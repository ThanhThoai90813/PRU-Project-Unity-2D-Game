  - Thank heavens! Thank you for saving me, thank you so much. We were almost eaten
    by the goblins!
  - My name is Sara. We were on our way to a nearby village when we were ambushed
    and kidnapped by goblins while resting for the night.
  - "That's right, the village of Horizon. Are you heading there too? That\u2019s
    great! We\u2019ll lead the way, and you can protect us on the journey!"

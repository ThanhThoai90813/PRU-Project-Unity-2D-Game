  - Hey, you! Sorry, you've been walking around the village for a while, right? Have
    you seen Sara? She looks just like me.
  - "We're from the same tribe and came to this village to live. Earlier, she suddenly
    joked that if I couldn't find her within 30 minutes, she'd leave\u2014then she
    ran off."
  - Oh, that childish personality of hers...
  - Oh, you saw her? Near the market? Oh, thank you so much! You really saved me
    from a big loss.
  - Here, take this as a thank-you. Goodbye, I'm off to find her now!

  - Oh, a young traveler, are you also heading to Horizon Village?
  - "Me? I'm out gathering some herbs. Those damn Mushrooms are such a nuisance\u2014let
    your guard down for just a moment, and they pop up out of nowhere!"
  - Be careful ahead. Anyway, I've heard rumors that goblins have been causing trouble
    lately.
  - Here you go, take them. Just some extra herbs I have no use for. Good luck!

  - Hmm? Huh? Who are you? Do I know you?
  - Oh, I'm Babak. Who are you? Do I know you?
  - What? Speak up, I can't hear you!
  - Witch what?
  - Oh, the forbidden witch? Let me think for a moment...
  - Wait a moment..
  - Wait a moment..
  - Oh, I remember now! Lately, there's been a rumor about a witch who knows everything
    in the world.
  - I don't really believe it, but I've heard that her house is to the south, deep
    in that forest
  - What? You want to go there? You might want to think twice about that.
  - Why? To get there, you'd have to cross a forest trail, but recently, a gang of
    bandits has taken over the area. They ambush and rob unsuspecting travelers.
  - Why doesn't the king do anything about them? Haizz..

  - Hmm, a young adventurer, huh? What do you need from me?
  - Just so you know, I don't take outrageous requests, haha.
  - "You want information about someone? And even a specific location?? Hmm, that\u2019s
    going to be a bit tricky."
  - "Alright, since you went through all the trouble to find me, I'll accept your
    request. But on one condition\u2014you must fulfill this task for me."
  - "It's simple. See that castle in the distance? Yes, that one. I need you to go
    there\u2014how you get in doesn't matter. Just bring me the thing its master
    is hiding."
  - Don't worry, its master has gone to the battlefield, taking the elite soldiers
    with him. Only a few stragglers and some skeletons remain. I also happen to know
    that the item I need is being guarded by his pet.
  - "When you complete the task, I promise to give you the information you need.
    As a little bonus\u2014trust me, I'm reliable\u2014the person you're looking
    for has a name that starts and ends with 'A,' right?"
  - Sounds easy, doesn't it? Haha, best of luck!
  - The road is right ahead. Hurry up and go!
